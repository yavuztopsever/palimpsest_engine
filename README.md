## Consciousness-Driven CRPG Engine

**[Palimpsest Engine](https://palimpsest.org) is a specialized CRPG development platform built for creating Disco Elysium-style narrative games.** Based on the proven Godot Engine foundation, Palimpsest adds consciousness mechanics, bureaucratic systems, and German Expressionist aesthetics to create immersive psychological RPGs where thoughts reshape reality.

Palimpsest transforms traditional game development by making **mental states physically affect the game world** through consciousness fields that distort architecture, alter NPC behavior, and influence procedural generation.

## Key Features

### üß† Consciousness Field System
- **8 Consciousness Types**: Depression, Anxiety, Anger, Memory, Bureaucratic, Creative, Fear, Hope
- **Reality Distortion**: Mental states physically reshape environments
- **Thought Cabinet**: Internalized skills and memories that affect gameplay
- **Cascade Effects**: Emotional states spread and influence other systems

### üìñ Advanced Narrative Tools
- **Yarn Spinner Integration**: Industry-standard dialogue system
- **Skill Check Mechanics**: Probability-based interaction with consciousness modifiers
- **Branching Narratives**: Complex story trees with state persistence
- **Memory Fragments**: Scattered recollections triggered by environmental cues

### üìã Bureaucratic Gameplay
- **Form Systems**: Interactive paperwork with validation mechanics
- **Stamp & Signature Tools**: Official document processing
- **Red Tape Simulation**: Complexity scoring and bureaucratic obstacles
- **Administrative Puzzles**: Logic-based form completion challenges

### üåç Procedural Generation
- **Wave Function Collapse**: Consciousness-influenced level generation
- **Brutalist Architecture**: Modernist concrete structures reflecting mental states
- **Conditional Generation**: Building layouts adapt to player psychology
- **Narrative Integration**: Procedural spaces support story beats

### üé® German Expressionist Renderer
- **Monochrome Palette**: High-contrast black and white with selective color
- **Selective Red Accents**: Blood-red highlights for critical elements
- **Angular Aesthetics**: Sharp, modernist visual design
- **Distortion Effects**: Reality warping based on consciousness intensity

### ‚öôÔ∏è Specialized Editor
- **5 Custom Workspaces**: Narrative, Consciousness, Bureaucracy, World Building, Testing
- **CRPG-Focused Tools**: Node types filtered for narrative development
- **German Expressionist Theme**: Editor matches game aesthetic
- **Integrated Validation**: Built-in checks for CRPG best practices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6+** (for build system)
- **SCons 4.0+** (build tool)

## Philosophy

Palimpsest Engine embodies the concept of a **palimpsest** - a manuscript where earlier writing shows through later text. In our engine:

- **Consciousness** is the earlier writing - persistent mental patterns
- **Reality** is the later text - the world as perceived and experienced  
- **Gameplay** emerges from the interaction between hidden psychology and visible events

This creates games where **internal states have external consequences**, making player psychology an integral part of the game world rather than just a narrative device.
