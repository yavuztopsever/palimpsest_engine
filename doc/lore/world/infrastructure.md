# Infrastructure Systems of Palimpsest

## Overview

Palim's infrastructure operates on dual levels: the visible civic systems that citizens interact with daily, and the hidden technological foundations that actually sustain the city. The Bureau maintains this deception to preserve the illusion of bureaucratic omnipotence while concealing their dependency on advanced technology and Continuum's guidance.

## Core Survival Systems

### Food Production and Distribution

**Hydroponic Towers** (Primary Source)
- **Technology**: Bureau-operated vertical farms using advanced nutrient solutions
- **Output**: Sterile vegetables, vat-grown proteins, processed grains
- **Characteristics**: Efficient but deliberately bland to reduce consciousness stimulation

**Fisheries** (Secondary Source)
- **Operation**: Dockland fleets harvest coastal waters under Bureau quotas
- **Products**: Fish, mollusks, kelp preserved in salted blocks
- **Regulation**: Heavily taxed and monitored to prevent independence
- **Black Market**: Fishing crews secretly trade unregistered catches
- **Consciousness Impact**: Maritime work maintains connection to pre-Collapse cultural memories

**Anomaly Produce** (Illegal/Underground)
- **Source**: Fruits, vegetables, and grains spontaneously manifested by consciousness distortions
- **Characteristics**: Unpredictable effectsâ€”some nutritious, others hallucinogenic or dangerous
- **Bureau Response**: Officially banned as "reality contamination hazards"
