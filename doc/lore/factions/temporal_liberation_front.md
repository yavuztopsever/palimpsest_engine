# The Temporal Liberation Front (TLF)

## Overview

The Temporal Liberation Front represents the most radical resistance faction in Palim, committed to the complete overthrow of Bureau authority and the liberation of consciousness enhancement for all citizens. Unlike other factions that work within or around the system, the TLF actively wages guerrilla warfare against Bureau control, using consciousness effects as tools of revolution while seeking to establish a post-Bureau society based on consciousness freedom and authentic human development.

## Faction Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

**Revolution as Necessity**: The Bureau system cannot be reformed or worked withinâ€”it must be completely destroyed and replaced with authentic human self-governance.

**Consciousness as Liberation**: Enhanced consciousness represents humanity's natural evolution toward freedom and should be embraced by all people rather than suppressed or limited to elites.

**Authentic Self-Determination**: Human communities should govern themselves based on authentic relationships and consciousness-enhanced democracy rather than artificial bureaucratic control.

**Temporal Freedom**: Time itself has been colonized by Bureau control, and true liberation requires breaking free from artificial temporal structures and schedules.

### The Liberation Manifesto

**The Four Pillars of Freedom**:
1. **Destruction**: Complete elimination of Bureau authority and consciousness suppression systems
2. **Liberation**: Universal access to consciousness enhancement and freedom from artificial control
3. **Reconstruction**: Building authentic human communities based on consciousness-enhanced cooperation
4. **Evolution**: Guiding human development toward natural consciousness evolution and transcendence

**Revolutionary Creed**: "We fight so that consciousness may be free. We resist so that humanity may evolve. We revolt so that the future may be authentic."
