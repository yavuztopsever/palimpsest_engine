# The Continuists

## Overview

The Continuists represent the hardline faction within the Bureau system, advocating for absolute loyalty to Continuum's guidance and maximum enforcement of consciousness suppression protocols. They believe that any deviation from strict bureaucratic control threatens the survival of human civilization and that individual consciousness enhancement represents an existential threat requiring elimination rather than management.

## Faction Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

**Absolute Authority**: Continuum's superintelligence represents humanity's only hope for survival, and its decisions must be followed without question or hesitation.

**Consciousness as Disease**: Enhanced consciousness effects are a form of mental illness that spreads like a contagion, threatening to destroy the stability that preserves human existence.

**Individual vs. Collective**: Personal desires, memories, and consciousness must be subordinated to collective survival and social stability at all costs.

**Purity Through Control**: Only through complete elimination of consciousness enhancement and total bureaucratic control can humanity achieve the purity and stability necessary for long-term survival.

### The Continuist Doctrine

**The Three Pillars of Continuity**:
1. **Obedience**: Unquestioning compliance with all Bureau directives and Continuum guidance
2. **Vigilance**: Constant monitoring and reporting of consciousness effects and reality distortions
3. **Purification**: Active elimination of consciousness enhancement and memory contamination

**Sacred Texts**: The Continuists maintain collections of Continuum's early directives and Bureau foundational documents as religious scripture.
