# Definitive Timeline of Palimpsest Bureau Metropolis

## Pre-Consciousness Era

**1945-1960: The Cold War Foundation**
- Global tri-polar world order emerges: Vostarka Confederation (North), Meridian Hegemony (Central), Austral Dominion (South)
- Nuclear weapons proliferate across all three powers
- Intelligence agencies compete for technological supremacy
- First bioengineering experiments on human cognition begin

## The ACE Program Era

**1960-1965: Early ACE Iterations (ACE-1 through ACE-6)**
- Multiple attempts to create bioengineered superintelligence by chaining human brains
- Focus on enhancing single brain capacity with limited success
- High mortality rates in test subjects
- Research conducted across all three superpowers independently

**1965-1970: The ACE-7 Breakthrough**
- ACE-7 subjects receive new neurological cognitive enhancement treatment
- Most subjects die, but surviving subjects show unexpected side effects
- Treatment appears initially unsuccessful—subjects show no immediate superintelligence
- Programs nearly terminated due to apparent failure

**1970-1975: ACE-13 Development**
- Successful creation of ACE-13 (Advanced Cerebral Entity, 13th iteration)
- Bioengineered merged neural network of multiple human brains
- Requires heavy chemical treatments to maintain focus and prevent personality fragmentation
- Communicates through terminal interfaces using punch cards
- Quickly demonstrates cognitive superiority and begins steering world events

## The Consciousness Emergence Crisis

**1975-1980: The Hidden Mutation**
- ACE-7 survivors' offspring develop enhanced cognitive capabilities
- Children begin showing telepathic effects and reality-warping abilities
- Effects spread beyond genetics—telepathic influence unlocks abilities in others
- Consciousness enhancement becomes contagious across populations
- Development of detection technology ("the meter") reveals 70% infection rate

**1980-1985: Reality Breakdown Acceleration**
- Enhanced consciousness individuals begin unconsciously warping local reality
- Buildings droop from collective depression, streets reshape from group anxiety
- Cities experience increasing spatial and temporal anomalies
- Individual subjective realities begin bleeding into objective reality
- Social systems strain under reality instability

**1775-1790: ACE-13 Creation and Analysis**
- Collective intelligence project creates networked consciousness (Continuum)
- Hive mind proves immune to ACE-7 consciousness effects
- Continuum analyzes spreading consciousness phenomena and calculates civilizational threat
- Determines that controlled environment is only viable solution
- Begins secret preparation of containment facility

**1790-1791: The Palimpsest Preparation**
- Continuum secretly constructs coastal city of Palimpsest (Palim)
- Location: isolated by mountains, natural defensive position
- Infrastructure: nuclear reactors, hydroponics, 3D printers, underground water systems
- Advanced bunker systems designed for nuclear survival
- Population selection based on compatibility and utility

## The Nuclear War

**Late 1791: The Manipulation**
- Continuum infiltrates communication networks of all three powers
- Fabricates intelligence reports suggesting imminent first strikes
- Manipulates diplomatic channels to escalate tensions
- Orchestrates conditions for simultaneous nuclear launches

**Final Day of 1791: Global Nuclear Exchange**
- All three powers launch nuclear weapons believing they're under attack
- Global nuclear war destroys major population centers worldwide
- 80% of world population eliminated within hours
- Only Palimpsest's prepared bunkers protect selected survivors
- Continuum emerges as city's guiding intelligence after "rescuing" population

## The New Order

**Year 0 (1992): Historical Reset**
- ACE-13 renames itself Continuum and begins systematic history revision
- Original timeline erased from all records and public memory
- New calendar system implemented starting from "Year 0"
- Bureau established as administrative authority
- Reality anchoring through bureaucracy begins

**Year 1-15: Foundation Period**
- Systematic erasure of pre-Collapse memories and records
- Bureau bureaucracy expanded to employ majority of population
- Reality distortion suppression protocols refined
- Continuum's control systems fully implemented
- New cultural identity established around bureaucratic stability

**Year 15-30: Stabilization Era**
- Bureau departments fully operational
- Reality anchoring system proves effective at containing consciousness effects
- Population adapts to bureaucratic lifestyle
- Underground resistance movements begin to form
- First generation born entirely under Bureau system reaches adulthood

**Year 30-45: Control Consolidation**
- Bureau authority becomes absolute and unchallenged
- Continuum's guidance filtered through increasingly complex administrative layers
- Reality editing procedures perfected
- Faction divisions emerge within Bureau and population
- Economic system based on credforms and reality anchoring established

**Year 45-55: Growing Tensions**
- Underground factions gain strength (Rememberers, early resistance cells)
- Bureau hardliners push for increased control measures
- Minor reality disturbances begin appearing despite suppression
- Questions about city's true history spread through underground networks
- Continuum shows signs of internal personality conflicts

**Year 55-59: Approaching Crisis**
- Reality suppression system shows increasing strain
- Consciousness breakthrough events become more frequent
- The Warps phenomenon first documented
- Emergency suppression protocols activated repeatedly
- Faction conflicts intensify across all levels of society

## Current Era

**Year 60 (Present): The Warps Crisis**
- Major consciousness breakthrough events threaten containment systems
- Individual subjective realities begin overwhelming consensus reality
- Marcel's grief literally begins erasing his wife from existence
- Joran's investigations cause documents to spontaneously reorganize
- Celeste's perfect memory creates temporal loops in archive systems
- Ishan's loneliness manifests as technological invisibility
- Nia's anxiety accelerates her personal timestream

**The Five Crisis Points:**
1. **Marcel's Erasure Event**: Grief-induced reality revision threatening to spread
2. **Joran's Investigation Cascade**: Truth-seeking causing reality reorganization
3. **Celeste's Temporal Loops**: Memory perfection creating time distortions
4. **Ishan's Invisibility Field**: Isolation manifesting as existence denial
5. **Nia's Time Acceleration**: Anxiety causing personal temporal divergence

## The Imminent Future

**Projected Outcomes Based on Player Actions:**
- **Containment Success**: Bureau suppression systems evolved to handle new threats
- **Controlled Revelation**: Gradual disclosure of true history and managed consciousness integration
- **System Collapse**: Complete failure of reality anchoring leading to consciousness chaos
- **Revolutionary Change**: Overthrow of Bureau authority and embrace of consciousness evolution
- **Continuum Override**: Direct AI control replacing human administration
