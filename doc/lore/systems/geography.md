**Peripheral Zones**: The Fog Quarter and outer residential areas occupy lower elevations and peripheral locations, reflecting their lower status within the Bureau hierarchy while providing space for underground activities and community development.

**District Boundaries**: Natural and artificial geographical features serve as district boundariesâ€”ridgelines, river channels, major transportation corridors, and consciousness-induced spatial distortions that create distinct neighborhood identities.

## Climate and Weather

### Natural Climate Patterns

**Temperate Continental**: Palim experiences four distinct seasons with moderate precipitation, providing diverse weather conditions that affect both agricultural production and urban life throughout the year.

**Seasonal Variations**: Spring brings renewal and increased consciousness activity, summer provides peak productivity and community celebration, autumn emphasizes harvest and preparation, winter encourages reflection and underground network strengthening.

**Precipitation Patterns**: Regular rainfall supports agriculture and maintains river flow while creating atmospheric conditions that enhance consciousness effects and provide cover for underground activities.

**Temperature Ranges**: Moderate temperature variations require seasonal adaptation in housing, clothing, and community activities while influencing consciousness enhancement development and community gathering patterns.

### Consciousness-Affected Weather

**Reality Storm Systems**: Consciousness-induced weather phenomena that create temporary spatial distortions, memory precipitation, and atmospheric conditions that enhance or suppress consciousness abilities in affected areas.

**Bureaucratic Weather Control**: Bureau efforts to regulate weather patterns through administrative procedure and consciousness suppression, creating artificially stable conditions that support productivity while limiting environmental consciousness enhancement.

**Community Weather Influence**: Underground consciousness enhancement communities that collectively influence local weather patterns, creating microclimates that support community activities and cultural preservation.

**Temporal Weather Events**: Weather systems that arrive from impossible directions or display anachronistic characteristics, reflecting the complex relationship between consciousness enhancement and physical reality.
