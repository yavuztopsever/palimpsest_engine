## Basic Information

**Name**: Finnegan Seamus McGrath  
**Age**: 35  
**Function**: Independent Risk Assessment Consultant  
**District**: Market Sprawl (Uncertainty Trading Exchange)  
**Consciousness Status**: Probability Enhancement (Future possibility visualization)  

## Appearance

Finn moves through the Market Sprawl with the careful deliberation of someone constantly calculating odds. His eyes dart between multiple futures simultaneously, occasionally stopping to stare at empty space where he observes probability threads invisible to others. He dresses in practical business attire with numerous pockets containing dice, calculators, and probability charts, tools that help him channel his consciousness effects.

His consciousness enhancement manifests as **probability visualization**â€”he can perceive multiple potential futures as branching possibility streams, allowing him to calculate odds and predict outcomes with uncanny accuracy.

## Background and History

### Early Life and Natural Intuition
Born to a family of small-time gamblers and risk-takers, Finn demonstrated an unusual ability to predict outcomes from childhood. He could sense when dice would roll favorably, predict which vendors would have the best deals, and anticipate market fluctuations hours before they occurred.

### The Enhancement Event
**Year 54**: During a massive market crash when chaos theory and random fluctuations threatened to destroy the entire Market Sprawl economy, Finn attempted to predict and prevent the economic collapse by calculating increasingly complex probability scenarios. The strain of processing thousands of variables simultaneously triggered his consciousness enhancement.

**The Manifestation**: While frantically calculating probability outcomes to prevent economic disaster, Finn began seeing multiple potential futures as visible streams of possibility. He realized he could perceive the branching paths of reality and calculate the probability of different outcomes by observing the density and flow of possibility streams.

### Current Role
Finn operates as the Market Sprawl's premier risk assessment specialist, using his probability consciousness effects to help businesses and individuals make decisions with optimal outcomes. He serves as both consultant and safeguard against random disasters that could destabilize the commercial district.
