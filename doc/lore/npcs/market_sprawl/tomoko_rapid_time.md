# Tomoko "Rapid Time" Hayashi

## Basic Information

**Name**: Tomoko Rei Hayashi  
**Age**: 28  
**Function**: Mobile Commerce Coordinator  
**District**: Market Sprawl (High-Velocity Trading Zone)  
**Consciousness Status**: Severe Temporal Enhancement (Personal TDI 3.2-4.8)  

## Appearance

Tomoko appears to exist in constant fast-forward, moving with jerky, accelerated motions that make her difficult to follow visually. She speaks rapidly, often finishing conversations before others realize they've started. Her business attire shows signs of temporal distortion—fabric that seems to age and renew itself cyclically, and accessories that appear to exist at multiple time points simultaneously.

Her consciousness effects manifest as **temporal acceleration**—she experiences time 3-5 times faster than normal consensus reality, allowing her to conduct multiple business transactions simultaneously while others experience single moments.

## Background and History

### Early Life and Natural Speed
Born to a family of small merchants, Tomoko always seemed to live life at an accelerated pace. As a child, she completed school assignments before teachers finished explaining them, held entire conversations during the pause between question and response, and demonstrated an uncanny ability to predict market trends by hours or days.

### The Acceleration Event
**Year 56**: During a particularly frantic trading day when the Market Sprawl experienced a major commercial crisis, Tomoko attempted to coordinate emergency transactions across dozens of vendors simultaneously. The stress of managing multiple time-critical deals while preventing economic collapse triggered her consciousness enhancement.

**The Manifestation**: While racing between merchant stalls, Tomoko noticed she was moving faster than the crowds around her. Initially thinking she was hallucinating from exhaustion, she realized she could experience hours of personal time during minutes of consensus time, allowing her to complete massive amounts of work in impossibly short periods.

### Current Role
Tomoko has become the Market Sprawl's premier "crisis coordinator"—handling emergency commercial situations that require impossible speed and timing. Her temporal abilities allow her to prevent economic disasters by completing crucial transactions before problems can cascade throughout the commercial district.
