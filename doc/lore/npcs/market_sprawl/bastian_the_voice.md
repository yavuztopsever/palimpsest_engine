# Bastian "The Voice" Korver

## Basic Information

**Name**: Bastian Marcus Korver  
**Age**: 52  
**Function**: Senior Market Announcer and Commercial Communications Coordinator  
**District**: Market Sprawl (Central Trading Plaza)  
**Consciousness Status**: Auditory Enhancement (Sound-based reality manipulation)  

## Appearance

Bastian is a imposing figure who commands attention even when silent. His voice carries an impossible quality—it can be heard clearly across enormous crowds, penetrate closed buildings, and seem to come from multiple directions simultaneously. He dresses in traditional market announcer attire but speaks through an ornate brass megaphone that seems to amplify not just sound but meaning itself.

His consciousness effects manifest as **vocal reality manipulation**—his voice can influence not just what people hear, but what they think, feel, and sometimes even what physically happens around them.

## Background and History

### Early Career as Market Voice
Bastian began working in the Market Sprawl as a traditional announcer at age 16, calling out prices, deals, and market information to crowds of shoppers and traders. He demonstrated exceptional vocal power and clarity, able to project his voice clearly across the entire commercial district without amplification.

### The Enhancement Event
**Year 48**: During a major market panic when false rumors about currency collapse threatened to destroy the district's economy, Bastian attempted to calm the crowds through increasingly desperate announcements. As panic mounted and reality began destabilizing due to collective fear, his voice became something more than sound.

**The Manifestation**: While shouting reassurances to prevent an economic riot, Bastian's voice began to make his words literally true. Prices he announced became actual prices, market conditions he described became reality, and crowd emotions shifted to match his vocal tone and content.

### Current Role
Bastian has become the Market Sprawl's unofficial "reality anchor"—his voice maintains economic and social stability by announcing conditions that become true through consciousness effects. He serves as both information source and reality-shaping force for the entire commercial district.
