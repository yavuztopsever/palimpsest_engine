# The Translation Tower

## Overview

The Translation Tower operates as the Market Sprawl's linguistic coordination center, a multi-story building where polyglot merchants conduct business in dozens of languages simultaneously. Functioning officially as translation services and language education facility, the Tower secretly preserves suppressed languages and provides underground communication networks through linguistic diversity and cultural knowledge preservation.

## Physical Description

The Tower occupies a seven-story building with each floor dedicated to different linguistic families and translation services.
