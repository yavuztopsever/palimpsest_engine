# The Memory Mart

## Overview

The Memory Mart operates as the Market Sprawl's underground center for psychically resonant artifacts and objects that carry emotional imprints. Functioning officially as antique shop and cultural artifact dealer, the Mart secretly preserves suppressed memories and provides underground consciousness enhancement services through psychically charged objects and memory preservation activities.

## Physical Description

The Mart occupies an underground bazaar accessible through hidden entrances throughout the Market Sprawl. The building shows consciousness-induced memory organizationâ€”artifact collections that contain more emotional resonance than should be possible, display areas that enhance psychic connections to stored memories, and preservation chambers that become accessible only to memory specialists with consciousness enhancement abilities.

**Artifact Trading Floor**: Primary commercial area for consciousness-enhanced objects and psychically resonant artifact commerce  
**Memory Preservation**: Specialized chambers for authentic memory storage and consciousness enhancement artifact protection
