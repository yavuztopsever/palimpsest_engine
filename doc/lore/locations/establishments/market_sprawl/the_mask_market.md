# The Mask Market

## Overview

The Mask Market operates as the Market Sprawl's center for ceremonial and practical masks from countless cultures, a covered trading area where traditional identity objects are exchanged and cultural protection is provided through mask crafting and ceremonial activities. Functioning officially as cultural artifact shop and costume supplier, the Market secretly preserves traditional identity practices and provides underground identity protection through mask-based anonymity and cultural preservation.

## Physical Description

The Market occupies a large covered pavilion with display areas organized by cultural origin and ceremonial purpose. The building shows consciousness-induced identity organizationâ€”mask collections that contain more cultural authenticity than their origins should allow, fitting areas that provide perfect identity matching and cultural connection, and workshop sections that become accessible only to traditional craftspeople with cultural knowledge and mask-making expertise.
