# Mercy Clinic

## Overview

Mercy Clinic operates as the Fog Quarter's unofficial medical center, providing healthcare services to residents who cannot access or afford Bureau medical facilities. Run by former Bureau medical personnel and underground healthcare providers, the clinic treats both conventional medical conditions and consciousness enhancement-related health issues while maintaining the appearance of an approved community health education center.

## Physical Description

The clinic occupies a converted Bureau community center, its sterile exterior hiding extensive medical modifications within. The building shows signs of consciousness-induced healingâ€”walls that seem to emanate comfort, lighting that adjusts to patient needs, and an atmospheric quality that reduces pain and anxiety through subtle consciousness effects generated by enhanced medical staff.

**Treatment Rooms**: Six examination spaces equipped with salvaged Bureau medical equipment and consciousness-enhanced healing tools  
**Emergency Surgery**: Hidden surgical suite for treating injuries that can't be reported to Bureau authorities  
**Recovery Ward**: Disguised as community meeting room, provides extended care for consciousness enhancement side effects  
**Underground Pharmacy**: Secret medication storage and distribution for drugs unavailable through official channels
