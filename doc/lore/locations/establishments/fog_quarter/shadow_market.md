# Shadow Market

## Overview

Shadow Market operates as the Fog Quarter's primary black market trading hub, functioning officially as a Bureau-approved flea market while secretly serving as the district's center for underground commerce, alternative currency exchange, and consciousness enhancement supply distribution. The market provides essential goods and services unavailable through official Bureau distribution while maintaining plausible deniability through legitimate secondhand trading.

## Physical Description

The market occupies a large abandoned Bureau warehouse, its official exterior concealing extensive internal modifications for underground commerce. The space shows consciousness-induced commercial organizationâ€”stalls that seem to contain more inventory than physically possible, corridors that lead to specialized trading areas, and sections that become visible only to specific types of customers.

**Official Flea Market**: Front section featuring approved secondhand goods and Bureau-compliant trading  
**Underground Commerce**: Hidden sections accessible through consciousness-enhanced navigation for black market trading
