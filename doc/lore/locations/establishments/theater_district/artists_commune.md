# The Artists' Commune

## Overview

The Artists' Commune serves as the Theater District's primary residential and creative hub for consciousness-enhanced artists, operating officially as an approved cultural housing cooperative while secretly functioning as the Guild of Artisans' central community and training facility. The complex houses dozens of consciousness-enhanced artists in purpose-built studios that facilitate both artistic creation and consciousness development while maintaining the appearance of standard Bureau-approved collective housing.

## Physical Description

### Residential Architecture
The Artists' Commune occupies a renovated Bureau collective housing complex, its brutalist exterior hiding the consciousness-enhanced modifications within. The building appears to be standard worker housing from the outside, but consciousness-enhanced individuals notice subtle architectural anomaliesâ€”windows that seem larger from inside than outside, corridors that lead to more rooms than should physically fit, and common areas that feel impossibly spacious despite modest dimensions.
