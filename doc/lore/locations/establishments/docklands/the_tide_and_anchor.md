## Physical Description

A converted ship's hull that was dragged ashore decades ago and transformed into a permanent structure.

## Reality Distortions

The Tide and Anchor experiences several types of consciousness-related phenomena:

**Temporal Tides:** During emotional moments, the building briefly transforms to reflect different historical periods - sometimes appearing as it would have in the pre-Bureau era, other times showing glimpses of possible futures

## Narrative Significance

The Tide and Anchor represents the persistence of human culture and community under authoritarian pressure. It demonstrates how ordinary spaces can become centers of resistance simply by maintaining authentic human connections and cultural traditions.

Through this establishment, players can explore themes of cultural preservation, community solidarity, and the ways that shared food and gathering spaces serve essential human needs that bureaucratic systems cannot replicate or control.

The tavern serves as a microcosm of the larger struggle between human diversity and institutional homogenization, showing how people create meaning and maintain identity through simple acts of sharing food, stories, and traditions.
