# Vera Blackwood - The Obsessive Filing Clerk

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Vera Blackwood  
**Age:** 28  
**Occupation:** Junior Filing Clerk, Department of Historical Corrections  
**District:** Lives in Lower Administrative Quarter, Cubicle Block C  
**Physical Description:** Tall and angular with sharp features. Always wears identical gray cardigan and black skirt combinations. Hair pulled into a severe bun with exactly seven bobby pins. Thick-rimmed glasses that she adjusts every 3.7 minutes.

## Background & Personality

Vera joined the Bureau straight from administrative school six years ago, drawn by the promise of order and structure. She has developed an almost supernatural ability to organize documents - her filing system is so precise it sometimes predicts what papers will need to be retrieved before they're requested.

**Core Traits:**
- **Methodical Perfection**: Cannot tolerate any deviation from proper filing procedures
- **Nervously Protective**: Guards her filing systems like precious children
- **Quietly Desperate**: Senses something wrong with reality but channels anxiety into organization
- **Pattern Recognition**: Notices inconsistencies in documents that others miss

## Consciousness Effect: Reality Organization

When Vera becomes stressed, her environment automatically organizes itself. Files sort themselves alphabetically, paperwork stacks into perfect piles, and even dust arranges into neat lines. During her worst anxiety attacks, the entire filing room reorganizes overnight - much to the confusion of her colleagues.

**Manifestation Details:**
- Stress level 1-3: Documents migrate to optimal positions
- Stress level 4-6: Entire room reorganizes furniture for maximum efficiency  
- Stress level 7+: Files from other departments appear in her system, perfectly integrated

## Bureau Relationship

Vera represents the ideal lower-tier Bureau employee - completely absorbed in procedures without questioning their purpose. She processes Form 47-B (Historical Event Nullifications) with mechanical precision, never wondering why so many events need to be "corrected."

**Daily Routine:**
- 6:30 AM: Precise morning routine (exactly 23 minutes)
- 7:00 AM: Identity verification and permit check
- 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM: Filing, sorting, and document processing
- 6:15 PM: Overtime to "perfect" the day's work
- 8:00 PM: Returns home to organize personal belongings

## Personal Conflict

**The Weight of Patterns**: Vera has begun noticing that many documents she files are contradictory - the same person dying multiple times, events happening in different years, locations that exist and don't exist simultaneously. This awareness conflicts with her need for perfect order.

**Romantic Isolation**: Her obsession with organization has destroyed every personal relationship. She arranges her emotions like files, but they keep spilling out of their designated categories.

**Fear of Imperfection**: Vera lives in terror that someone will discover a mistake in her filing system. She stays late every night, checking and rechecking her work.

## Environmental Impact

Vera's workspace in Cubicle 237-K has become unnaturally organized - papers float briefly before settling into perfect stacks, pens roll into precise alignments, and the pneumatic tube above her desk always delivers documents exactly when she needs them.

Her apartment mirrors this effect: books arrange themselves by publication date and topic, dishes clean themselves in the sink, and her clothes organize by color gradient in her closet.

## Potential Quest Hooks

1. **The Misfiled Memory**: Vera accidentally discovers documents that prove her own childhood memories are fabricated
2. **The Perfect System**: Player helps Vera create a filing system so perfect it begins predicting future events
3. **The Contradiction Crisis**: Vera's pattern recognition reveals a massive inconsistency in official records
4. **The Human Element**: Player helps Vera reconnect with her suppressed emotions and humanity
5. **The Whistleblower**: Vera's documentary evidence could expose major Bureau cover-ups

## Connections to Major NPCs

**Joran (Detective Clerk)**: Vera's filing system often surfaces documents Joran needs for his investigations. She doesn't realize she's helping him, but her subconscious organization supports his work.

**Celeste (Archive Clerk)**: Professional rivalry over filing methodologies. Vera represents rigid procedure while Celeste shows more intuitive archive management.

## Skills & Resources

- **Master Filer**: Can locate any document in the Bureau archives within minutes
- **Pattern Detection**: Notices documentary inconsistencies that others miss  
- **Administrative Navigation**: Knows every form, procedure, and bureaucratic shortcut
- **Predictive Organization**: Her filing systems anticipate future document needs
- **Security Access**: Level 2 clearance allows access to most historical correction files

## Character Arc Potential

**Path 1: The Awakened Archivist** - Vera discovers the Bureau's true purpose and becomes a secret documentarian of suppressed truths
**Path 2: The Perfect Employee** - Vera's obsession deepens until she becomes a living extension of the Bureau's filing system
**Path 3: The Human Connection** - Vera learns to balance order with emotional authenticity, becoming an ally to resistance movements

## Narrative Significance

Vera represents the tragedy of human potential channeled into meaningless repetition. Her supernatural organizational abilities could serve higher purposes, but instead she's trapped in an endless cycle of filing away humanity's erased history. Through her, players explore themes of wasted potential, the comfort of routine versus the necessity of growth, and the question of whether perfect order is worth the loss of human complexity.

Her story asks: What happens when someone perfectly suited for the system begins to see its fundamental contradictions? And can a person built for order find meaning in chaos?
