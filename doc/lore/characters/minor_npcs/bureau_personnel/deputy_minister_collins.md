# Deputy Minister Catherine Collins - The True Believer

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Catherine Elizabeth Collins  
**Age:** 59  
**Occupation:** Deputy Minister of Personnel  
**District:** Lives in Executive District, Government Housing Tower  
**Security Level:** Level 8 (Senior Command)  
**Physical Description:** Immaculately dressed in expensive Bureau-issued suits. Silver hair styled in perfect waves that never move out of place. Piercing blue eyes that seem to evaluate everything. Posture remains rigid even during private moments.

## Background & Personality

Catherine has served the Bureau for 31 years and is one of the few senior officials who fully understands humanity's psychic evolution and the nuclear apocalypse. She genuinely believes that Bureau control is not just necessary but noble - that Continuum and the administrative system represent humanity's salvation from evolutionary chaos.

**Core Traits:**
- **Absolute Conviction**: Unshakeable belief in the Bureau's mission and methods
- **Brilliant Administrator**: Exceptional talent for managing complex bureaucratic operations
- **Cold Pragmatism**: Willing to sacrifice individuals for what she sees as species survival
- **Paternalistic Care**: Believes citizens need protection from their own dangerous potential

## Consciousness Effect: Reality Enforcement

Catherine's unwavering belief in Bureau authority creates zones of enhanced reality stability around her. Psychic phenomena weaken in her presence, paperwork becomes more binding, and administrative procedures gain almost physical weight.

**Manifestation Details:**
- **Authority Field**: Administrative decisions gain supernatural enforceability near her
- **Reality Hardening**: Psychic distortions cannot manifest within 10 meters of her presence
- **Bureaucratic Weight**: Forms and documents become physically heavier and more durable when she handles them
- **Compliance Aura**: Citizens feel compelled to follow proper procedures in her vicinity

## Bureau Relationship

Catherine represents the Bureau's ideological core - someone who knows the truth and embraces it completely. She sees herself as humanity's guardian, protecting the species from its own evolutionary potential.

**Leadership Responsibilities:**
- Personnel assignment for all Bureau departments
- Psychological evaluation oversight for citizen monitoring
- Policy coordination between ministries and Continuum directives
- Crisis management for city-wide reality distortion events

## Personal Conflict

**The Loneliness of Truth**: Catherine is one of the few people who fully understands humanity's situation, creating profound isolation from both subordinates and citizens.

**The Weight of Decision**: Every policy she implements affects thousands of lives. She bears this responsibility as a necessary burden but it takes a psychological toll.

**Family Sacrifice**: Catherine never married or had children, believing personal attachments would compromise her ability to make necessary decisions for humanity's survival.

## Environmental Impact

Catherine's office in the Ministry Tower is a bastion of absolute bureaucratic order. Reality becomes more solid and predictable in her presence - clocks run precisely on time, paperwork never smudges or tears, and even dust settles in orderly patterns.

Her home reflects the same rigid perfection - furniture remains exactly positioned, books organize themselves by regulation standards, and electronic devices function with impossible reliability.

## Potential Quest Hooks

## Leadership Philosophy

## Narrative Significance

Catherine represents the danger of absolute certainty in service of good intentions. She demonstrates how genuine care for humanity can justify terrible actions when filtered through authoritarian thinking. Through her, players explore themes of paternalism, necessary evils, and the corruption that comes from holding too much power over others.

Her character raises crucial questions: Can good people do evil things for good reasons? When does protection become oppression? And who has the right to decide humanity's evolutionary path?

Catherine embodies the philosophical heart of the Bureau's tragedy - she truly believes she's saving humanity, even as her methods diminish what makes humans worth saving. Her absolute conviction makes her both the most dangerous and the most tragic figure in the Bureau hierarchy.
