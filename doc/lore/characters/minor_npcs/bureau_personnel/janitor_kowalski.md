# Stanisław "Stan" Kowalski - The Observant Janitor

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Stanisław Kowalski  
**Age:** 67  
**Occupation:** Senior Custodial Staff, Bureau Headquarters  
**District:** Lives in Worker Housing Complex, Lower Administrative Quarter  
**Physical Description:** Stocky build from decades of physical labor. Thick gray mustache and kind eyes that notice everything. Wears faded work coveralls with patches and modifications for comfort. Carries a wheeled cart full of cleaning supplies and mysterious tools.

## Background & Personality

Stan has worked as a janitor in Bureau facilities for 34 years, making him one of the longest-serving employees. His status as "invisible" maintenance staff has allowed him to witness countless conversations, observe patterns in official behavior, and develop his own theories about what the Bureau actually does.

**Core Traits:**
- **Observational Genius**: Notices details and patterns that escape trained investigators
- **Working-Class Wisdom**: Practical intelligence and street-smart understanding of human nature
- **Protective Discretion**: Guards secrets and protects people through selective blindness and strategic helpfulness
- **Quiet Subversion**: Uses his access and invisibility to subtly aid those he deems worthy

## Consciousness Effect: Practical Solutions

Stan's decades of solving everyday problems have given his psychic projection a uniquely practical bent. Broken things repair themselves around him, lost objects appear where they're needed, and bureaucratic obstacles resolve through convenient coincidences.

**Manifestation Details:**
- **Problem Resolution**: Mechanical and administrative difficulties solve themselves when Stan is nearby
- **Object Migration**: Items appear where people need them most - keys in locks, documents on desks, tools in hands
- **Structural Healing**: Buildings maintain themselves better in areas Stan regularly cleans
- **Social Harmony**: Interpersonal conflicts cool down when he's present, people become more cooperative

## Bureau Relationship

Stan represents the ultimate institutional insider - someone who's been present long enough to see everything but remains unnoticed by those in power. He knows more Bureau secrets than most administrators while officially knowing nothing.

**Daily Responsibilities:**
- Cleaning and maintenance of high-security offices and meeting rooms
- Equipment servicing and minor repairs throughout Bureau facilities
- Waste disposal and recycling, including sensitive document destruction
- Emergency cleanup during reality distortion events

## Personal Conflict

**The Weight of Secrets**: Stan has overheard decades of conversations and witnessed operations that would horrify most citizens. He struggles with the burden of this knowledge and his inability to act on it directly.

**The Invisibility Curse**: Being ignored and underestimated has given him access and freedom, but also deep loneliness and frustration with his powerlessness.

**The Complicity Question**: Stan questions whether his long service makes him complicit in Bureau activities, even if he's tried to help when possible.

## Environmental Impact

Areas under Stan's care function with unusual efficiency. Equipment lasts longer, repairs happen faster, and even the building itself seems more stable and comfortable. His cleaning cart contains far more supplies than should physically fit, and he always has exactly the right tool for any situation.

The janitor's closet where Stan stores his equipment has become a minor nexus of practical magic - lost items migrate there, broken tools repair themselves overnight, and useful supplies appear when needed.

## Potential Quest Hooks

His presence in the story provides players with a guide who understands both the system's weaknesses and the human cost of challenging it. Stan embodies the quiet heroism of those who choose to help when they could remain safely invisible.
