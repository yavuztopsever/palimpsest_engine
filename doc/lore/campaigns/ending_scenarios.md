# Ending Scenarios
*The Ultimate Consequences of Choice in Palimpsest Bureau*

## Ending Philosophy

The endings of Palimpsest Bureau reflect the accumulated weight of player choices throughout the campaign. Rather than simple "good" or "bad" endings, each conclusion represents a different philosophical approach to the fundamental question of human consciousness management. Every ending carries both triumphs and losses, reflecting the game's commitment to moral complexity.

### Ending Design Principles

**Philosophical Consistency**: Each ending flows logically from the player's demonstrated values and choices throughout the campaign.

**Bittersweet Complexity**: Every ending includes both positive achievements and meaningful sacrifices, avoiding purely triumphant or tragic outcomes.

**Character Integration**: Major NPCs play crucial roles in endings, with their development determining their contributions to final outcomes.

**Long-term Vision**: Endings project consequences decades into the future, showing how immediate choices reshape society permanently.

**Multiple Validity**: No ending is objectively superior - each serves legitimate human needs while creating legitimate concerns.

**Personal Investment**: Player relationships and character development significantly determine individual satisfaction with ending achieved.
