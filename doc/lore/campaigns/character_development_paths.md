# Character Development Paths
*Dynamic NPC Evolution and Player Influence Systems*

## Character Development Philosophy

Characters in Palimpsest Bureau are not static quest-givers but dynamic individuals whose personalities, beliefs, and capabilities evolve based on player interactions, world events, and their own psychological journeys. Each major NPC has multiple potential development paths that reflect different responses to trauma, moral dilemmas, and personal growth opportunities.

### Core Development Principles

**Psychological Authenticity**: Character changes follow realistic patterns of human development, including setbacks, breakthroughs, and gradual evolution.

**Player Agency**: Player choices significantly influence character development while respecting NPC autonomy and internal logic.

**Consequence Integration**: Character development affects all aspects of gameplay including available quests, dialogue options, faction relationships, and story outcomes.

**Bidirectional Influence**: NPCs also influence player character development through relationship dynamics and philosophical challenges.

**Reality Integration**: Character emotional states and development stages create corresponding reality distortions in the game world.
