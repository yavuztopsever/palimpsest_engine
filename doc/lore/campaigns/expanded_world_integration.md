# Expanded World Integration
*Incorporating Minor NPCs and Daily Reality Distortions into Campaign Narrative*

## Integration Philosophy

The expanded supporting cast of 11 minor NPCs and 7 establishments creates a living, breathing city where reality distortions affect daily life in subtle and profound ways. Each minor character has their own consciousness effects and story arcs that intersect with major questlines, creating a web of interconnected narratives that make Palim feel authentic and alive.

### Supporting Character Network Design

**Layered Narrative Integration**: Minor NPCs serve multiple functions - quest contacts, information sources, relationship development catalysts, and reality distortion examples.

**Daily Life Authenticity**: Each character represents a different approach to living with reality distortion, from denial to adaptation to exploitation.

**Cultural Diversity**: Characters represent different districts, professions, and philosophical approaches to consciousness management.

**Growth Potential**: Minor NPCs can develop throughout the campaign based on player interactions and world events.
