# Crisis Events and Responses
*Managing Reality Breakdowns and System Failures in Palim*

## Crisis Event Philosophy

Crisis events in Palimpsest Bureau serve as pressure points that force player choices, reveal character true natures, and advance the central narrative about consciousness, control, and human potential. Each crisis results from accumulated player choices and character development, making them feel both inevitable and personally meaningful.

### Crisis Design Principles

**Organic Development**: Crises emerge from character actions and relationship dynamics rather than arbitrary external events.

**Multiple Stakeholders**: Every crisis affects different characters and factions in different ways, creating complex webs of conflicting interests.

**No Perfect Solutions**: All resolution paths require meaningful sacrifice or compromise, reflecting the game's moral complexity.

**Escalating Stakes**: Early crises affect individuals and neighborhoods, while later crises threaten the entire city and its reality structure.

**Character Revelation**: Crisis response reveals character's true values and priorities when comfortable options are removed.

## Crisis Classification System

### Level 1: Personal Reality Crises
**Scale**: Individual to household level
