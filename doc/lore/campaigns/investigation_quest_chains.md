# Investigation Quest Chains
*Reality-Distorted Detective Work in Palimpsest Bureau*

## Core Investigation Mechanics

Investigation in Palim operates differently from traditional detective work due to reality distortions, memory suppression, and bureaucratic interference. Evidence can literally disappear, witnesses forget they ever existed, and the crime scene itself may change overnight.

### Investigation Principles

**Evidence Fragility**: Physical and testimonial evidence degrades over time as reality edits take effect. Players must work quickly or find ways to preserve information before it's officially "corrected."

**Unreliable Reality**: What appears to be evidence may be reality distortion, planted information, or consciousness projection. Players must verify sources and cross-reference multiple types of evidence.

**Bureaucratic Obstacles**: Official channels either block investigation or provide false information. Players must use informal networks and personal relationships to access truth.

**Emotional Truth**: Reality distortions often reveal psychological or emotional truths that objective evidence cannot capture. Players must interpret environmental changes as character testimony.

## Major Investigation Chains

### Chain 1: The Vanishing Clerk
**Duration**: 3-4 sessions  
**Complexity**: Beginner (Introduction to investigation mechanics)  
**Reality Distortion Level**: Low to Moderate

#### Synopsis
Bureau employee Edwin Mora has been systematically erased from existence over the past month. His desk remains, his work continues to be done, but no one remembers him except his sister Rosa, who hires the player to investigate his disappearance before she forgets him too.
