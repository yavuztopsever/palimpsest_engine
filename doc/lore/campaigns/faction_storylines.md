# Faction Storylines
*Branching Narratives for Competing Ideologies*

## Faction Design Philosophy

Each faction represents a distinct response to the fundamental question: "How should humanity manage its consciousness-shaping abilities?" Rather than simple good vs. evil dynamics, these factions embody different philosophical approaches to authority, freedom, truth, and collective survival. Player interactions with each faction explore the logical endpoints of their ideologies while revealing internal contradictions and human complexity.

### Core Design Principles

**Ideological Consistency**: Each faction's methods flow logically from their worldview, even when those methods seem extreme or counterproductive.

**Internal Diversity**: Every faction contains moderates and extremists, creating opportunities for player influence and internal conflict.

**Moral Ambiguity**: Each faction serves legitimate human needs while creating legitimate human suffering, making no choice purely virtuous.

**Dynamic Response**: Faction policies and relationships change based on player actions and broader city events.
