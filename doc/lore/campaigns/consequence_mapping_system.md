# Consequence Mapping System
*Tracking the Ripple Effects of Choice in Reality-Distorted Palim*

## Core Philosophy

Every significant choice in Palimpsest Bureau creates cascading consequences that manifest across multiple layers of reality: individual psychology, social relationships, district stability, faction dynamics, and city-wide reality coherence. This system ensures that no major decision exists in isolation, making player choices meaningful while creating organic narrative complexity.

### Cascade Principles

**Temporal Layering**: Consequences manifest at different time intervals
- Immediate (within same session)
- Short-term (next 2-3 sessions) 
- Medium-term (next story arc)
- Long-term (affects ending conditions)

**Reality Integration**: Choices affect both social structures and literal reality
- Character psychological states create environmental distortions
- Social tensions manifest as reality instabilities
- Major revelations trigger city-wide consciousness fluctuations

**Interconnected Systems**: No consequence exists in isolation
- Character relationship changes affect faction standing
- District stability influences available questlines
- Faction conflicts create opportunities and restrictions

## Major Choice Categories and Consequences

### Truth vs. Order Decisions

**High Truth, Low Order Choices**
- Exposing Bureau lies publicly
- Supporting radical transparency movements
- Encouraging reality distortion acceptance

**Immediate Consequences:**
- NPC relationship changes (truth-seekers +positive, authorities -negative)
- Reality distortion increases in immediate area
- Underground faction reputation improvement

**Short-term Consequences:**
- Bureau monitoring and investigation of player
- Access to restricted information through resistance contacts
- Reality anchoring effectiveness decreases

**Medium-term Consequences:**
- District-wide reality instability events
- Faction questlines unlock (Rememberers, TLF)
- Bureau questlines become more adversarial

**Long-term Consequences:**
- Revolutionary ending paths become available
- Reality becomes more malleable but less predictable
- Social systems either transform or collapse

**High Order, Low Truth Choices**
- Supporting Bureau suppression efforts
- Reporting resistance members to authorities
- Helping maintain reality anchoring systems

**Immediate Consequences:**
- Authority figure relationship improvements
- Reality becomes more stable locally
- Underground contacts become suspicious or hostile

**Short-term Consequences:**
- Access to official resources and information

- Reality remains stable but human potential is limited
- Social control systems become entrenched

### Individual vs. Collective Priority Decisions

**High Individual Priority Choices**
- Saving specific NPCs despite broader consequences

- Supporting policies that harm some for greater good
- Prioritizing strategic advantage over personal relationships

**Character Relationship Effects:**
- Group leaders develop respect for player's commitment
- Sacrificed individuals or their allies become hostile
- Other group members see player as reliable but potentially cold

**Faction Standing Changes:**
- Increased standing with goal-oriented factions
- Access to leadership positions and strategic information
- Reputation as someone willing to make hard choices

**District Stability Impacts:**
- More stable collective reality but increased individual psychological stress
- Efficient resource allocation but potential for individual breaking points
- Stronger institutional structures but reduced personal resilience

## Faction Relationship Matrices

### Inter-Faction Consequence Cascades

**Bureau-Rememberer Tensions:**
```
Player Actions Affecting Both:
- Truth revelations harm Bureau while helping Rememberers
- Reform efforts may satisfy both through compromise
- Crisis response cooperation can build temporary alliances
- Individual NPC relationships can bridge factional divides

Consequence Patterns:
- High Bureau standing + High Rememberer standing = Reform advocate role
- High Bureau + Low Rememberer = System loyalist path
- Low Bureau + High Rememberer = Underground resistance path
- Low Bureau + Low Rememberer = Independent operator challenges
```

**Continuum-TLF Opposition:**
```
Fundamental Incompatibility:
- TLF consciousness enhancement directly opposes Continuum optimization
- Any support for one faction automatically reduces standing with other
- Crisis situations force explicit choice between technological vs. evolutionary paths
- Compromise positions satisfy neither faction

Strategic Positioning:
- Players can gather intelligence by maintaining contact with both
- Double agent scenarios possible but extremely risky
- Final crisis forces ultimate choice between machine optimization vs. human transcendence
```

## Reality Distortion Consequence Integration

### Personal Reality Zones

**High-Relationship NPC Areas:**
- Spaces around deeply trusted NPCs become more stable and supportive
- Player presence enhances positive reality effects
- Strong emotional connections create "sanctuary zones" during crisis
- Negative consequences in these areas feel more traumatic and meaningful

**Hostile Relationship Areas:**
- Spaces around antagonistic NPCs become more challenging and unstable
- Player presence may trigger reality distortions reflecting conflict
- Failed relationships create "dead zones" resistant to positive change
- Redemption efforts in these areas require greater investment but yield greater rewards

### District-Wide Reality Patterns

**Choice Resonance Effects:**
- Major player choices create "reality echoes" affecting similar situations
- Consistent choice patterns establish "player reality signature" 
- Districts develop personality reflecting dominant player approach
- Reality becomes more responsive to player consciousness over time

**Collective Consciousness Integration:**
- Player choices influence collective unconscious of district populations
- Major revelations create "awakening waves" spreading beyond intended targets
- Reality becomes more malleable but potentially unstable as consciousness spreads
- Final reality state reflects accumulated choices across entire campaign

## Crisis Event Cascade Triggers

### Level 1 Crisis Triggers (Individual Scale)
```
Accumulated Choice Thresholds:
- Any major NPC reaches critical psychological breaking point
- District stability drops below 30/100 for extended period
- Player reality distortion abilities exceed safe management levels
- Faction conflict escalates to direct confrontation

Intervention Opportunities:
- Personal counseling and relationship repair
- Community support mobilization  
- Reality anchoring through bureaucratic procedures
- Faction mediation and compromise negotiation
```

### Level 2 Crisis Triggers (District Scale)
```
Multiple System Failures:
- 2+ major NPCs in crisis simultaneously
- 2+ districts below stability threshold
- 3+ faction relationships in hostile range
- Reality distortions spreading between locations

Resolution Requirements:
- Coordinated response across multiple systems
- Major resource allocation decisions
- Faction cooperation despite ideological differences
- Player leadership in crisis coordination
```

### Level 3 Crisis Triggers (City Scale)
```
System Collapse Indicators:
- 3+ districts in critical instability
- All faction relationships either hostile or dependent
- Reality distortions creating permanent environmental changes
- Consciousness field coherence breakdown

Final Choice Forcing:
- No compromise solutions remain viable
- Player must choose fundamental approach to human consciousness management
- Previous relationships and choices determine available options and allies
- City's reality future depends on player's ultimate philosophical commitment
```

```

### Quality Assurance Metrics
```
Choice Meaningfulness Assessment:
- Every major choice must affect at least 3 game systems
- No choice should be obviously superior without trade-offs
- Consequences must feel inevitable in hindsight but surprising initially
- Player agency must remain meaningful regardless of previous choices

Narrative Coherence Verification:
- Character development must remain psychologically realistic
- Faction responses must align with established ideologies
- Reality distortions must follow consistent rules
- District changes must reflect accumulated social dynamics
```
