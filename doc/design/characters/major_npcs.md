# Major NPC Visual Designs
**The Five Faces of Palimpsest's Crisis**

*"These five individuals carry the weight of the city's future in their faces, their postures, their very presence. Each represents a different response to institutional oppression, and their appearances should make their internal conflicts visible to anyone who encounters them."*

## Character Design Philosophy for Major NPCs

Each major NPC serves as a visual embodiment of different responses to Palimpsest's consciousness crisis. Their designs should immediately communicate their role in the narrative while showing the physical and psychological toll of living in a reality-warping city.
