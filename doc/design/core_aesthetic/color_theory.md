# Color Theory for Palimpsest
**The Psychology of Oppression and Resistance Through Color**

*"In a world where consciousness shapes reality, color is not decoration—it is the visible language of human emotion breaking through systematic control."*

## Core Color Philosophy

Palimpsest's color system operates on three fundamental principles:

1. **Institutional Suppression**: Official colors designed to drain emotional energy and enforce compliance
2. **Consciousness Bleed**: Authentic human emotions manifesting as color breakthrough
3. **Reality Distortion**: Colors that shouldn't exist, created by consciousness warping physics

## The Master Color Wheel

## Color Interaction Rules

### Consciousness Bleed Mechanics
When institutional colors encounter consciousness bleed:

1. **Gradual Seepage**: Emotional colors slowly infiltrate gray areas through cracks, edges, and worn surfaces
2. **Resistance Patterns**: Gray surfaces develop subtle color variations that spell out resistance messages
3. **Breakthrough Moments**: Sudden explosions of color during emotional climaxes or revelations
4. **Suppression Recovery**: Institutional colors attempting to reclaim consciousness-affected areas

### Color Mixing Behaviors
- **Gray + Red**: Creates pink undertones suggesting suppressed passion
- **Blue + Gold**: Produces green hints, suggesting institutional wisdom becoming life-affirming
- **Purple + Any Institutional Color**: Creates impossible shades that hurt to look at directly
- **White + Any Consciousness Color**: Results in warm, comforting tints

### Temporal Color Changes
Colors that shift over time based on narrative and consciousness field strength:

**Daily Cycles:**
- Morning: Cooler, more institutional colors dominate
- Midday: Consciousness colors begin breaking through
- Evening: Warmest, most human colors appear
- Night: Either comforting intimate colors or oppressive darker tones

**Narrative Progression:**
- Early Game: Overwhelming grays with rare color breaks
- Mid Game: Increasing consciousness bleed as player actions create change
- Late Game: Full spectrum available based on player choices and character development

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### For Artists
**Color Picking Workflows:**
1. Start with institutional base colors
2. Add consciousness bleed based on emotional context
3. Include anomaly colors for reality distortion effects
4. Ensure color combinations support narrative themes

**Texture Development:**
- Create institutional textures in base grays
- Develop overlay systems for consciousness bleed effects
- Design anomaly textures with impossible color properties

### For Developers
**Dynamic Color Systems:**
- Implement color variables tied to consciousness field strength
- Create smooth transition systems between institutional and bleed colors
- Develop anomaly color effects that respond to reality distortion events

**Performance Optimization:**
- Use color lookup tables for dynamic institutional-to-bleed transitions
- Implement LOD systems for complex consciousness color effects
- Optimize anomaly color shaders for performance

*"Color in Palimpsest is never merely decorative. Every hue carries the weight of human emotion struggling against systematic suppression. The victory of a single red thread in a gray uniform represents the triumph of individual identity over institutional control. The emergence of impossible purple in a bureaucratic corridor signals reality itself rebelling against the systems designed to contain it."*
